                            <h4>The time of new arrivals, big cities and diplomacy</h4>
                            <p> Most of the known races of the world have arrived here at this time. First were humans and orcs arriving together on a long ships near the northern shores of Eteon.
                                While mostly barbaric and much less sophisticated than races of angels and demons, they were very good and surviving and thriving in colder climates building a powerful culture there.
                                The initiative to fill the world with animals from other planes has resulted in a race of snake-people coming and inhaviting the southern part of the continent, with their magical prowess they were able to transport other animalistic races there as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>This time was mainly charaterised with:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Establishment of diplomatic relations between the races</li>
                                <li>Consolidation of power between different growing countries and kingdoms</li>
                                <li>Arrival of many new inhabitants to the continent as well as increasing population of wildlife</li>

                            <h4>The time of arrival, suspicion and survival</h4>
                            <p> This was a time when most of the living things arrived in the world of Runia, it was a world freshly created as a side-effect of a magical spell cast somewhere in the multiverse and was created barren and devoid of life. 
                                Nobody knows how long did this world stayed like this, but the first arrivals to this world were refugees of demons and angels, tired of the unending war between each other on other planes they sought a place to escape and build a peaceful and prosperous life.
                                In this time those 2 races tried to live somewhat peacefully with one another, trying to bring some life into this land.  
                            </p>
                            </p>

                                <li>Very small amount of living beings in the world</li>
                                <li>Hardship to tame the barren land and to receive basic sustenance from it, as this world had no living creatures, only earth, rocks and possibly minerals beneath the earth</li>
                                <li>A raising amount of suspicion as the two refugee races had a long history of enmity</li>
                            </ul>
